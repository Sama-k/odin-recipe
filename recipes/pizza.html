        <h1>HOME-MADE PIZZA</h1>

        <h2>how to make it?</h2>
        <p>The best part about pizza is that it is actually pretty quick if you have everything ready to go. I’m going to share my exact method for baking pizza that I have been using for about 10 years now. It’s tried and tested, and results in delicious, crispy-edged, perfectly cheesy pizza every time.</p>
        <h4>ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><em>flour</em></strong></li>
            <li><strong><em>sausage</em></strong></li>
            <li><strong><em>cheese</em></strong></li>
            <li><strong><em>veggies of choice</em></strong></li>
            <li><strong><em>ketchup</em></strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <p>
            <li>Make the pizza dough: Follow the Best Pizza Dough recipe to prepare the dough. (This takes about 15 minutes to make and 45 minutes to rest.)</li>
            </p>
            <p>
            <Li>Prepare the toppings: Slice or tear the fresh mozzarella into small pieces. </Li>
            </p>
            <p>
            <li>Bake the pizza: When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you don’t have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. </Li>
            </p>
            <p>
            <li>Spread the pizza sauce over the dough using the back of a spoon to create a thin layer. Add the pieces of fresh mozzarella cheese evenly across the dough, then top with the shredded mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle evenly with the garlic powder, dried oregano, and a few pinches of kosher salt.</li>
            </p>
            <li>Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven). Slice into pieces and serve immediately.</li>
